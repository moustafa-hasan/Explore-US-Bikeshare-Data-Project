# Explore US Bikeshare Data
###### **Udacity Data Analyst Degree - Project**
## Overview
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike-sharing systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York, and Washington. I added the code needed to import data and answer interesting questions about it by calculating descriptive statistics. I also added a script that takes initial input to create an interactive experience in the device to present these stats.

## What Software Do I Need?

**For this project, the following software requirements apply:**
- You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda.
- A text editor, like Atom.
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

## The Datasets
**Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 is provided for all three cities. The three data files all have the same six (6) core columns:**
- Start Time 
- End Time 
- Trip Duration (in seconds)
- Start Station 
- End Station 
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
**The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:**
- Gender
- Birth Year

## The Files
**The questions answers will be provided using a Python script. For guiding you through this project, comments are provided in the bikeshare.py file. You will need the three city dataset files:**
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

## Displayed statistics
- The most frequent times of travel.
- The most popular stations and trip.
- The total and average trip duration.
- Bikeshare users.
